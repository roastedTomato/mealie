### Short Interpretation

Write 2-4 sentences explaining what this measurement shows.

Example:

> The one-shot workflow produced a large amount of React code quickly, but the build failed and only a small number of core smoke routes passed. Most failures came from missing routing and incompatible assumptions about the existing Nuxt/Vue structure. This suggests that a single high-level prompt is useful as a baseline but not sufficient for a controlled framework migration.
